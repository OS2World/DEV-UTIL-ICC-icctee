ICCTEE

KEYWORDS: OS2,CSET2,TEE,SOM,WPS,IAN,IBM,....


ICCTEE performs 3 functions

1) filter unwanted warning messages from the ICC compiler

2) copy stdin to stdout

3) if the 1st argument is different from - the filtered input is also
   copied to the file

returns:
    0: ok no error
   -1: ok string "error EDC" detected in the input flow
   -2: bad arguments
   -3: can't open output file

Usage
-----

  ICCTEE <FileName> <string 1> <string 2> .... <string n>

  the lines containing <string1> ... <stringn> will be suppressed from
  the output

  if one of the string is "SOM" the messages EDC0811, EDC0805, and 
  somInitializeClass will be suppressed.

Note:
-----

  ONLY the messages containing "warning" are filtered.


  In one of my typical makefile the dependance looks like:

  {.}.c.obj:
     ICC.EXE /Ss /Kb+ /Kp- /W2 /Ti /Gm /Ge- /G4 /C .\$*.c | icctee .\$*.err SOM

NOTE2:
------

  I hope this program will be useless in the next release of ICC, when
  Ian Ameline will add the funct. of this program to the C/Set 2 2.0
